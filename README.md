# MatchTracker
MatchTracker is a modern web application for tracking and managing game series and results. Built with TypeScript, React, and AWS services (Lambda, DynamoDB, Cognito, S3), it allows users to create and manage game series, record match results, and view standings—all while staying within AWS Free Tier limits.
